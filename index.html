        Gandhiji informed <i><u>Lord Irwin</u></i> of his plan on 2nd March 1930.
        He would lead a <code>of people from his</code> <mark><b>Ashram at Sabarmati on 12th March 1930</b></mark> and
        walk through
        the villages of
        Gujarat.
        <br>
        On reaching the coastal village of <u>Dandi</u> he would make salt from seawater thereby breaking the salt act.
        Gandhiji started the march as planned with 80 of his followers.
        <br>
        They were given <em>strict instructions</em> not to
        resort to any kind of violence.
        <br>
        Thousands of people thronged the path from Sabarmati Ashram to Ahmedabad to witness the historic event.
        At the end of every day,
        <br>
        Gandhiji would address thousands of people and attack the government in his speeches.
        Gandhiji talked to <i>british journalist</i> and wrote articles for newspapers on the way. This pushed the
        Indian
        <br>
        independence movement into the forefront of world media. Gandhiji became a household name in the West.
        Sarojini Naidu joined him on the way. Every day more and more people joined him and on 5th April 1930, they
        reached Dandi.
        <br>
        At this time, there were about 50,000 people participating in the march.
        On the morning of 6th April 1930, Gandhiji broke the salt law by making salt. Thousands of people followed suit.

        The British government was shaken by the movement. Also, its non-violent nature made it difficult for them to
        suppress it violently.
        This movement had three main effects:
        It pushed Indian freedom struggle into the limelight in western media.
        It brought a lot of people including women and the depressed classes directly in touch with the freedom
        movement.
        It showed the power of the non-violent <em>Satyagraha</em> as a tool in fighting imperialism.
        Gandhiji was <u>released from prison in 1931</u> and he met with <cite>Lord Irwin</cite> who was keen to put an
        end to the civil
        disobedience movement and the media attention it had caught.
        As per the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, the <s>civil disobedience</s> movement would be ended and Indians, in return,
        would be
        allowed to make salt for domestic use. Lord Irwin also agreed to release the arrested Indians. Gandhiji attended
        the Second Round Table Conference in London as an ‘equal’ </h2>
