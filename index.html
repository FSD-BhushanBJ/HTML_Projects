    <p><h4>In 1989 <h2><mark>Carl Johnson</mark> </h2>escaped from the pressures of life in <em>Los Santos</em> San Andreas â€” a city tearing itself
        apart with gang trouble, <br>drugs, and <b>corruption.</b> Where film stars and millionaires do their best to avoid the
        dealers and gangbangers.

        Now, it's the early '90s. Carl's got to go home. His mother has been murdered, his family has fallen apart and
        his childhood friends are all heading toward disaster.

        On his return to the neighborhood, a couple of corrupt cops frame him for homicide. CJ is forced on a journey
        that takes him across the entire state of San Andreas, to save his family and to take control of the streets.</h4>

        Trust believes it's a drug overdose. <b>Ernesto's son Tommy,</b> a high-ranking DEA agent, goes to Mexico and finds
        Marco, who is his primary contact with Morales Cartel. Tommy destroys a Virgillo gang convoy and their gas
