    <p>According to historical records, Shivaji came to Bengaluru as a 12-year-old with his <strong>Mother Jijabai.
    </strong> 
    <br>
    They had
        been summoned by his father Shahaji Raje, then a Jagirdar of Bijapur rulers (the Kempegowda ruler had been
        defeated by the Adilshahi Sultans of Bijapur sometime during 1640-42).
        <br>

        In his book <mark>‘Shivaji and His Times’ </mark> (published in 1973), historian <i><u>Sir Jadunath Sircar</u></i> records
        Jijabai’s letter
        <br>
        to her husband Shahaji, in which she informs him that at 12, Shivaji had gone long past marriageable age for a
        Maratha nobleman</p>
        <br>
    <p>As such, around 1640, Jijabai and Shivaji duly arrived in Bengaluru,
        <br>
         accompanied by Jijabai and Dadaji Konddeo
        (the head of Kondana fort and Shivaji’s guardian). 
        <br>
        Soon after, Shivaji’s wedding to Saibai Nimbalkar of Phaltan
        took place in the palace where Shahaji lived and governed the city.
        <br>

        Interestingly, according to another version of the events that unfolded, Shivaji’s first wedding to Saibai had
        already taken place at Lal Mahal in Pune in the absence of his father.
        <br> Thus, to meet his son and
        daughter-in-law, 
        <br>
        Shahaji <s>summoned</s> the couple with Jijabai to Bengaluru and repeated the wedding ceremony at his
        palace.

        As for the exact location of this palace, it remains shrouded in mystery and disputes, with historical records
        providing little information. According to the Karnataka State Gazetteer of Bangalore District (Urban) — edited
        by the 
        <br>
        <mark>late Karnataka historian Suryanath U Kamath </mark> — the Gauri Mahal Palace in the present-day Bengaluru’s
        Chickpet area (near Majestic) is where Shahaji and his family are believed to have lived.</p>
