    <h3> Started MotorBeam.com back in 2008 while I was still pursuing my graduation. Post my graduation, I went ahead
        to do my MBA but continued working on MotorBeam making it a full-time profession in mid-2012.<br>

        In mid-2017, I started vlogging, giving a raw POV feel of cars and bikes. Right from motovlogging to lifestyle
        vlogging, I have won the top influencer award multiple times
